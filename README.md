# Quantica
A fast and scalable object database designed to store large amounts of structured and unstructured data.
Quantica is one of the few databases that is both modular, polymorfistic and is able to build relationships between all structures.
There is no genetic data architecture, structure or storage convention but rather an implicit model based on the existing data.

## Features
- 64bit processing and storage
- Fast data insert (200,000 records/s)
- Persistent storage on disk
- Globally unique keys
- Store any kind of data regardless of the size
- Event-driven / non-blocking network (45.000 req/s)
- WebAPI requests
